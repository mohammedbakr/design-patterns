## SOLID PRINCIPLES

- #### Single Responsibility Principle
  - A class should only have one reason to change.
  - **Separation of concerns** - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
- #### Open-Closed Principle
  - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- #### Liskov Substitution Principle
  - You should be able to substitute a base class for a subtype.
- #### Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dont't put too much into an interface, split into separate interfaces.
  - **YANGI** - You Ain't Going Need It.
- #### Dependency Inversion Principle
  - High-level modules shoun't depend upon low-level ones, use abstractions.

### SOME DEFINITIONS TO BE AWARE OF

- **God object:** huge massive class, lots and lots of responsibilities
- **State space explosion:** the entire approach doesn't work for infinity
- **Least surprise:** there shouldn't be any surprises or lack of behavior using a method
