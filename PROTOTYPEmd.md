## PROTOTYPE [_(creational)_](GAMMA.md#creatoinal-patterns)

A partically or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

- Complicated objects aren't designed from scratch
  - They reiterate existing designs
- An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a **Prototype**
- We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
  - Require **_deep copy support_**
- We make the cloning covenient (e.g., via a [Factory](FACTORY.md))
